# hello-world
my first experience with github and future coding

Yes, its so wird, but i like new things, so... Im an accountant, but i want to try coding, it souds interesting so im slowly getin in to it. I hope it will work because I have a couple ideas for my web sites: one is about basketball ( I played ball for loooong time:), other about accounting, my younger daughter id into digital painting and basketball and my other daughter is into cooking and basketball.  

I appreaciate all tips on my coding-ture.
